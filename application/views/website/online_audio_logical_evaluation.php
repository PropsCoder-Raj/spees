Result of this evaluation is used to develop an individualized treatment plan in order to improve their communication skills. There are Specialized test protocols for infants and young children.</p>

                            <p class="width-100 mx-auto d-inline-block sm-width-100">Audiological assessment is a painless, noninvasive hearing test. Audiological evaluation is carried out by medical professionals called Audiologists.</p>

                        <p>In an audiological evaluation Pure tone audiometry (PTA) is an important, simple and a basic test. This test is using to identify the hearing thresholds of an individual, it enable degree, type and configuration of hearing loss. It is based on the behavioural response of an individual. Therefore this test is only used on adults and children old enough to cooperate with the test procedure.</p>

This test is similar to the pure tone test, but instead of listening to different tones, you listen to certain words spoken at different volumes.</p>

These soft sounds are called Oto Acoustic Emissions. If the hearing loss is greater than 25-30 dB HL, OAEs will not produce.</p>

                                <p class="width-85 lg-width-90 md-width-100">Hearing screenings for newborns and infants are simple and painless. Your baby rests or sleeps during the test. The two common screening methods for babies are otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and auditory brainstem response (ABR).</p>
                                <p class="width-85 lg-width-90 md-width-100">There are 5-6 infants who are hard of hearing out of 1000 neonates. They will not be identified till they attain 2 or more years of age. This late detection means that crucial years of stimulating the hearing centers of the brain will have been lost. The maturation and development of the hearing mechanism may be affected. Speech and language development will not begin. Social and emotional development may be retarded. And future success in school could be threatened. Additionally, some of these children may incorrectly be branded as difficult or intellectually inferior, simply because they have an undetected hearing impairment. Universal hearing screening of new-borns is the only way to decrease the burden of deafness in our society.</p>

                        <p>BERA( Brain Stem Evoked Response Audiometry) is an objective electrophysiological test to identify the hearing loss and site of lesion. This test does not require the participation of the patient, All you have to do is rest quietly or sleep during the test, hence it is a more accurate and useful test in childrens. It is a useful tool for early identification. this test is carried out by placing electrodes on different positions and the electrodes will record the neural activities in responds to the sounds you hear through headphones.</p>
